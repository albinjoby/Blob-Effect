## Features

- A blob that smoothly follows the mouse cursor.
- Centered blob alignment with respect to the cursor.
- Interactive and responsive to user movements.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works

1. **HTML**: A simple `div` with an id `blob` is used to create the blob element.
2. **CSS**: The blob is styled to have a fixed size and background color. It is absolutely positioned to allow free movement across the screen.
3. **JavaScript**: Mouse movement is tracked, and the position of the blob is updated in real-time so that it follows the cursor. The blob's position is adjusted to ensure that it stays centered on the mouse pointer.
